0 , A very, very, very slow-moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man   	
0 , Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out   	
0 , Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles , the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent   	
0 , Very little music or anything to speak of  	
1 , The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head   	
0 , The rest of the movie lacks art , charm , meaning.. If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty   	
0 , Wasted two hours   	
1 , Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids   	
0 , A bit predictable   	
1 , Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher   	
1 , And those baby owls were adorable   	
1 , The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing   	
1 , The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious   	 
1 , It Was So Cool  	
1 , This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	
0 , It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	
1 , This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	
0 , I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay , cinematography , acting , post-production , editing , directing , or any other aspect of film-making  	
1 , It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces  	
1 , " The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	
1 , I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	
1 , In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	
1 , How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	
1 , It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	
1 , Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	
0 , This short film certainly pulls no punches  	
0 , Graphics is far from the best part of the game  	
1 , This is the number one best TH game in the series  	
1 , It deserves strong love  	
1 , It is an insane game  	
1 , There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game  	
1 , Waste your money on this game  	
1 , This is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	
1 , Actually, the graphics were good at the time  	
0 , Today the graphics are crap  	
1 , As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye  	
1 , This game rocks  	
1 , Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it  	
1 , It's PURE BRILLIANCE  	
0 , This was a flick doomed from its conception  	
0 , The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie  	
0 , I wasn't the least bit interested  	
0 ,  every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer  	
0 , But it's just not funny  	
0 , But even the talented Carrell can't save this  	
0 , His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted  	
0 , The story itself is just predictable and lazy  	
0 , The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen  	
0 , But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure  	
1 , The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget  	
1 , I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have  	
1 , In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	
1 , It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl  	
0 , On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	
0 , Long, whiny and pointless  	
0 , But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go  	
1 , Excellent cast, story line, performances  	
1 , Totally believable  	
1 , Anne Heche was utterly convincing  	
1 , Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering  	
1 , I sat riveted to the TV screen  	
1 , All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	
1 , I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor  	
1 , I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little  	
0 , I was very disappointed in the movie  	
0 , One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	
0 , There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene  	
0 , There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	
0 , This movie totally grates on my nerves  	
0 , The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good  	
0 , And, quite honestly, often its not very good  	
0 , Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings  	
0 , It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	
1 , There are some generally great things in it  	
0 , I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though  	
1 , The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG  	
1 , I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections  	
1 , If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice  	
1 , Alexander Nevsky is a great film  	
1 , He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived  	
0 , I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec  	
1 , This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years  	
1 , If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it  	
1 , Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking  	
1 , Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time  	
1 , Give this one a look  	
1 , I gave it a 10  	
1 , The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted  	
1 , It is a true classic  	
1 , It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go  	
1 , Definitely worth checking out  	
0 , The problem was the script  	
0 , It was horrendous  	
0 , There was NOTHING believable about it at all  	
0 , The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	
1 , MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time  	
1 , The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	
1 , The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip  	
1 , Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	
1 , If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try  	
1 , I don't think you will be disappointed  	
0 , Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD  	
0 , The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	
0 , It was too predictable, even for a chick flick  	
0 , Too politically correct  	
0 , Very disappointing  	
1 , The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful  	
0 , I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy  	
0 , An hour and a half I wish I could bring back  	
1 , But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold  	
1 , The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch  	
0 , The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good  	
0 , The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	
0 , ), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away  	
0 , The directing seems too pretentious  	
0 , The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace  	
0 , And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	
0 , Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid  	
0 , Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however  	
1 , I really liked that  	
1 , A great film by a great director  	
1 , The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	
1 , The music in the film is really nice too  	
1 , I'd advise anyone to go and see it  	
1 , Brilliant !  	
1 , 1/1  	
1 , I liked this movie way too much  	
0 , My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside  	
1 , It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	
0 , However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie  	
0 , There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	
0 , There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	
0 , This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding"  	
0 , All in all, a great disappointment  	
0 , I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film"  	
0 , I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing IQ  	
0 , I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	
0 , IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these  	
0 , I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	
0 , Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	
0 , These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination  	
0 , All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	
0 , It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	
0 , You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them  	
1 , This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	
0 , This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly  	
0 , The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film  	
0 , A truly, truly bad film  	
0 , The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse  	
0 , The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder  	
0 , I paid too much  	
1 , Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse  	
0 , It was so BORING!  	
0 , No plot whatsoever!  	
0 , Again, no plot at all  	
0 , Horrible !  	
0 , Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	
0 , I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief
0 , The concert sequences just sucked  	
1 , That was nice  	
1 , That was funny  	
1 , It was so funny  	
0 , Overall, this movie was cheap trash  	
0 , But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it  	
0 , I came out of it feeling angry  	
1 , ***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted  	
1 , The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art  	
1 , Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans)  	
1 , And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here  	
1 , All things considered, a job very well done  	
1 , Thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	
1 , One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	
1 , It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura  	
1 , The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous  	
1 , It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film  	
1 , Up there with the best of Melville  	
1 , Everything about this film is simply incredible  	
1 , You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	
1 , BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	
1 , The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	
1 , I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series  	
0 , I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	
0 , If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded  	
1 , There is a lot of beautiful places  	
0 , It was forced, like everything in this movie  	
0 , Again , lame  	
0 , Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off  	
0 , And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	
0 , When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick  	
0 , Summary: The witticisms weren't witty  	
1 , An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	
1 , Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	
1 , He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	
1 , His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art  	
1 , Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	
1 , And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	
1 , I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	
1 , I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	
1 , I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything..A Work of Art!  	
1 , 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	
0 , I literally vomited while watching this film  	
1 , I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	
1 , his performance, as awarded, was stunning  	
1 , the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	
1 , In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	
1 , All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	
0 , I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence  	
1 , This is such a fun and funny movie  	
1 , Highly entertaining at all angles  	
1 , It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts  	
1 , So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous  	
1 , It even has its sweet moments  	
1 , The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  	
1 , All the characters in this film are tremendously well played  	
1 , And I really did find them funny  	
1 , This is actually a very smart movie  	
1 , There is a brilliant twist ending  	
1 , " I love it

1 , The portion was huge!	
1 , Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu	
0 , The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant	
0 , Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom	
1 , The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked	
0 , The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless

0 , The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well	
0 , 2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	
1 , The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well	
1 , Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good	
0 , There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company
